# CaloMeter
A Diet Tracking Android Application that helps you keep fit by maintaining a Calorie Counter. Set your current weight, target weight, and the number of days within which you need to drop those pounds, and you're set! The app automatically calculates your daily goal (calories to lose). You can add the food items you've eaten and exercise performed. The app uses its food and exercise database to calculate the net amount of calories gained or lost. If you fail to reach today's target, the remaining calories are carried over to the next day.
